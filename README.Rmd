# roxygen2path

[![Lifecycle: experimental](https://img.shields.io/badge/lifecycle-experimental-orange.svg)](https://lifecycle.r-lib.org/articles/stages.html#experimental)
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of roxygen2path is to make it easy to document scripts with {roxygen2} style documentation and then render and load that documentation by creating a mock package.

## Installation

You can install the development version of `{roxygen2path}` like so:

``` r
# pak::pkg_install("elipousson/roxygen2path")
```

The package suggests my fork of the `{sinew}` package:

``` r
# pak::pkg_install("elipousson/sinew")
```

## Related packages

This package is significantly inspired by the [document package](https://gitlab.com/fvafrcu/document).
